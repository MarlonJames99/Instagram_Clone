## Project:
That's a clone of Instagram's login page made for educational purposes.<br>
In the same way we do in the original page, we have inputs to sign in with our email, phone or username and our password. It also has the option to create an account, recover your password and download the mobile app from App Store and Google Play.<br> 
It's obviously a front-end project so we only have the interface, it does not allows you to access any social media.

## Tecnologies:
<div style="display: inline_block">
<img align="center" alt="HTML logo" height="35" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original.svg">
<img align="center" alt="SCSS logo" height="35" width="40" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/sass/sass-original.svg">
</div>

## Other aspects:
In the development of the project, special attention was given to the correct application of semantics in its HTML structure.<br>
The favicon is not the same image from the original page but I liked.

## Next steps:
> I'm going to change the dimensions from px to rem, and make the page responsive.<br><br>
> Improve it's SCSS organization creating variables in root to use through the code, in place of using it individually everytime.
